                <h1>To You, Who’s Always in My Heart,</h1>
                
                <p>Every time I talk to you, there's a warmth I can't quite explain. Your smile makes my ordinary days feel special, and your laughter... it's like a melody that soothes my soul.</p>
                
                <p>Maybe I don’t hold a special place in your heart yet, but you already have a big space in mine. You're not just someone I admire — you're someone who makes me believe that sincere love still exists.</p>
                
                <p>I often imagine how beautiful it would be to spend days with you — sharing laughter, enjoying quiet moments, and telling little stories that only we understand. In your eyes, I see a future full of hope. Not because I’m sure it will be mine, but because I know you deserve every bit of it.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for being your kind, patient, and wonderful self. Even your smallest presence makes my world feel more colorful.</p>
                
                <p>I won’t force the direction of this story. But if someday we walk the same path, I want you to know that I will do my best to be someone you can count on — in both joy and sorrow.</p>
                
                <p>Islam may forbid dating, but it never forbids falling in love. And if expressing one’s feelings with sincere intention is not a sin, then let me say it in this moment: I like you.</p>
